STEPS TO EXECUTE THE CODE:
The following are the steps to follow to execute the code:

Step-1: Firstly, please upload the "project2.ipnyb" notebook into your Google colab using the upload notebook option.

Step-2: As I have written all the algorithms in the same notebook, just run all the cells at a time by clicking on "run all" under the "runtime" option located at the top.

Ater successfully running all the cells, you will see that 4 files are generated with the names as "price5.txt", "price10.txt", "price20.txt" and "price30.txt" at "/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/" location and you will see the output 

Below is just a small description to let you know what's the code written in each and every cell:

The first cell in the "project2.ipnyb" contains the code to mount your google drive to the "project2.ipnyb" notebook.The code in the next cell is just used to import all the necessary packages. I have written algorithms for Recursive top-down approach, Dynamic Programming Extended-Bottom-up approach and Memoized approach in different cells. Then in other cell, I have written a function called algorithms to call all the three algorithms and print rod length, maximum revenue, optimal cuts and execution time for all three of them. In another cell, I have written the code to generate random price files. Then, in the last cell I have written the main function in which I initialized the rod lengths and called the algorithms function.

Note: 

Additional/Optional info:

The flollowing is the google colab link for project2.ipnyb incase if you wish to execute the code directly in the google colab:
